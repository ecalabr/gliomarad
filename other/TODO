model.fit not working (crashes) with variable length epochs, workaround with epoch for loop
eventually would be nice to get model.fit working with variable length epochs so steps_per_epoch does not neet to be specified

see if shapes and batch size are actualy needed for Input layer in net builder. If not, then model could be loaded directly from save in predict.py instead of rebuilding from netbuilder.
