add evaluate.py
- make standard study list for training set and evaluation set, perhaps make shuffle with set random seed in param file?
- detailed metrics for evaluate
- evaluate metrics over whole 3d brain but only in brain parenchyma

metrics choices for training validation
- param file? consider MAE, MSE, MAPE

Eventually maybe add custom evaluation between epochs?

model.fit not working (crashes) with variable length epochs, workaround with epoch for loop
eventually would be nice to get model.fit working with variable length epochs so steps_per_epoch does not neet to be specified

test nonzero weighted pixel loss

histogram matching of input images as a normalization method?

brain and tumor combined mask
