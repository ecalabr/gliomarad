implement integration of - move all tumor segmentation to the end so the model doesnt have to be loaded each time (attempted)
consider a way to prevent log file from being overwritten if it completed successfully (not sure how to start)
dont repeat human readble and numpy metadata outputs if they already exist
incorporate topup DTI files when/where they exist
"gad t1" named series are not currently converted images - need to redo masking, nii4d, and tumor seg on these studies as well
make nets for image segmentation and synthetic CT


test fix issue where matching series names are repeated instead of using each unique name

test series matching numbering output to logger - CHECK
test series list numbering printing to series_list.txt (may need to delete old versions) - CHECK
test human readable series dict outputs - CHECK
